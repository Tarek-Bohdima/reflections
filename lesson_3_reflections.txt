When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - When collabrating on a project with others
    - For sharing my work with others or as showcase
    - as a backup and mobility (to open from different machines)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	- to ensure the code is logically pulled and keep in working condition

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	- Clones is just copying repository from one location to another locally or
	remotely like from Github, fork is same like clone but its specially for 
	Github; cloning a repository on github to my repository on github
	while branch is the line of consecutive commits for a feature or main code
	or even experimenting it helps in making paraller progress and keep the 
	code working

	- i would use branch if i want to add feature or experiment to a repository
	- i clone repository on my machine from Github when i want to edit the code
	- i fork a repository on Github when i want to test it or add to it but i don't have 
	permission to collabrate on that repository
