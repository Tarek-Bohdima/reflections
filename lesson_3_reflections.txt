When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - When collabrating on a project with others
    - For sharing my work with others or as showcase
    - as a backup and mobility (to open from different machines)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	- to ensure the code is logically pulled and keep in working condition
