When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - When collabrating on a project with others
    - For sharing my work with others or as showcase
    - as a backup and mobility (to open from different machines)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	- to ensure the code is logically pulled and keep in working condition

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	- Clones is just copying repository from one location to another locally or
	remotely like from Github, fork is same like clone but its specially for 
	Github; cloning a repository on github to my repository on github
	while branch is the line of consecutive commits for a feature or main code
	or even experimenting it helps in making paraller progress and keep the 
	code working

	- i would use branch if i want to add feature or experiment to a repository
	- i clone repository on my machine from Github when i want to edit the code
	- i fork a repository on Github when i want to test it or add to it but i don't have 
	permission to collabrate on that repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	- this can be done by git fetch origin	
	- it will be useful when i go offline say like on a plane and want to use git diff or
	git log and see whats new on the original repository from other's collabrators
	- i can merge (when i am still offline even) the origin/master and master branches
	- i can push the merged branch back to github (origin) after i get internet access

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	- i would use google drive or google docs to collabrate with others 
	- it would be hard to do that realtime. many bugs can be introduced
	- not sure if its suitable for code either as github
	- it will be harder..nothing easy about it

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? 
What benefits does each approach have?

	- working in separate branch is useful when collabrating ,and if the project is big
	and i want to keep the master code working ,so i experiment or add feature on other
	branches before i merge them to master and delete them.
	- so its useful for collabration to avoid conflicts on master
	- to organize the workflow in coding and keep master working
